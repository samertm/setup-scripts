# Setup Scripts

Scripts to set up my workstation just the way I like it. Meant to be run during a new computer setup.

To set up:

```
./init.sh
```

To install everything:

```
$ babushka computer
$ babushka gnome.lib # for gnome 3 desktop
```

# TODO

 - Set up [apt-select](https://github.com/jblakeman/apt-select)
